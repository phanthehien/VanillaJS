    "content": "Customers in Tohoku Electric Power’s network service area (six prefectures constituting the Tohoku region plus Niigata) can use their smartphone to settle their electricity bills by scanning the barcode on their bill\n\n \n\nTOKYO – October 30, 2018 – LINE Pay Corporation, operator of the LINE Pay smartphone digital wallet service available through the LINE messaging app, announces that Tohoku Electric Powers Co., Inc. (\"Tohoku Electric Powers\") will accept electricity bill payments with LINE Pay’s Scan Bill from today.\n\n \n\nTohoku Electric Power supports LINE Pay through Densan System Co., Ltd.’s collection agency service. It is the third power company to support LINE Pay after TEPCO and Kyushu Electric Power.\n\n \n\nStarting today, Tohoku Electric Power customers residing in the company's network service area that spans seven prefectures – Aomori, Akita, Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima, and Yamagata of the Tohoku region, plus Niigata – can pay their electricity bills using LINE Pay's Scan Bill feature.\n\n \n\nScan Bill enables users to settle public utility bills and mail order invoices with their LINE Pay account balance at anytime, just by scanning the barcode printed on the bill. Scan Bill helps to reduce overdue invoices by eliminating the need for users to prepare cash and visit stores to pay their bills. This makes the service useful for both payers and beneficiaries.\n\n \n\nBecause payments made with Scan Bill count towards LINE Pay's My Level user incentive program *1, users can save on their utility fees and mail orders by settling them with Scan Bill. With Tohoku Electric Power, users receive a specified amount of LINE Points for settling their electricity bills with LINE Pay, and can use the Points to pay off their future bills *2.",
